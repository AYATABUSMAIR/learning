   T he number of web applications being created and used has grown rapidly since the new
   millenium. And importantly , so has the sheer complexity
    of them - specially on the front end no the front end .
     no more static pages , no sir !

    you have a ton of sections each interacting with
    each other and the server and yes ,
    its as complicated as it sound and just as hard to pull  of today
    , I d like to talk about a few , choice javaScript
    frameworks that aim to simplyify front end application development.
